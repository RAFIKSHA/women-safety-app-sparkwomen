        <item>According to the International Research Centre for Women, almost 47 percent of girls
            are married before the age of 18. Currently, India ranks 13 in the world when it comes
            to child marriages. Since child marriage has been steeped into the Indian culture and
            tradition since centuries, it has been tough eliminating it.

            The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act was made effective in 2007. This act defines child
            marriage as a marriage where the groom or the bride are underage, that is, the bride is
            under 18 years of age or the boy is younger than 21 years.

            Parents trying to marry underage girls are subject to action under this law. Since the
            law makes these marriages illegal, it acts as a major deterrent.

        <item>The objectives of this act is to provide – a special form of marriage in certain
            cases, provide for registration of certain marriages and, to provide for divorce. In a
            country like India and with the diverse religions and cast, when people from different
            faiths and caste chose to get married they do it under the Special Marriage Act.

            It is not applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir and also extends to intending
            spouses who are Indian nationals and living abroad.

        <item>According to this act, taking or giving of dowry at the time of the marriage to the
            bride or the bridegroom and their family is to be penalised. Dowry system, giving and
            taking of dowry, is a norm in India. Dowry is often asked of the bride and her family by
            the groom and his family. The system has taken strong roots because women after marriage
            move in with their spouse and in-laws. Also, over the centuries, the lack for economic
            independence of women and the taboo towards divorce has resulted in bride burning. When
            demands for dowry even after marriage are not met by the girl’s families, many women are
            tortured, beaten and even burnt.
            It is one of the major challenges that our society is grappling with. Women openly
            complaining about it has helped to spread the word and encourage other women to take a
            stand.
